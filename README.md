# Chat Application Django

- Description:
+ Users need to sign up and login to be able to use the site. Each user has basic information: name, birth-date, phone number, email, avatar, address, social media links, and friend counts. They can make friends with each other, so we have friend features.

+ Users can create groups and add other users to them. Users can change the names of other people (only in the chat section). This app will have chat's features: emoji, post picture, on/off status (last offline time). Each message has information about the date and time.

+ They can find each other as friends or not, but if they want to send messages to stranger, they need to wait for their accept, users also can change this feature in setting. They can block users, turn off notifications in selected chats, or turn whole application's notifications off until they turn on again or just for a period of time.
